A firefox/chrome extension that redirects to TOR-accessible versions of pages as advertised in [`Onion-Location` headers and meta tags](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/onion-location/).

This does *not* provide good privacy guarantees; but instead:

  - Normalizes TOR usage, so it is less of an oddity for anyone looking at network traffic
  - Makes hidden services available in your regular browser
  - Doesn't put load on TOR exit nodes when accessing hidden services
